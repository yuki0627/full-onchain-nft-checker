# Full On-chain NFT Checker - Chrome Extension

**Full On-chain NFT Checker** is a Chrome extension designed to determine whether an NFT displayed on OpenSea is stored on-chain or off-chain. This distinction is made using our API that processes the underlying details of the NFT.

## Features

- üöÄ **Instant NFT Verification**: Automatically verify if an NFT on OpenSea is fully on-chain or off-chain when you visit a specific NFT or collection page.
- üîí **Privacy Focused**: The extension doesn't collect or share any user data. All determinations are made using public NFT data.
- üåê **API Driven**: Utilizes the powerful API we developed to fetch and process data reliably.
